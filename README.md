## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a seasoned Java Developer with expertise in Scala, Golang, and JavaScript, gained through work in health tech, payment systems, CRM, digital asset management, investments, and telecommunications, across NGOs and global enterprises.

Passionate about empowering coders, I focus on Agile methodologies, software best practices, and development tools, with a special emphasis on optimizing learning for neurodiverse individuals. As a father, I fosters my childrenâ€™s tech curiosity.

Academic and Continuous Learning: Holding an MSc in Computer Science with a specialization in machine learning, I continually enhances my skills through courses in project management, AI, and more.

Snapshot of my Journey:
15+ years in Agile software development.
5 years leading software teams.
6 years mentoring developers.
2 years teaching classrooms of up to 40 students.

I started coding at 14 with BASIC on DOS 3, fueling a lifelong passion for software. Coffee (6-10 cups daily) driving my creativity, I am often inspired by futuristic, Sci-fi dreams.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m an underwater explorer, scuba diver, and homemade chocolate connoisseur.
